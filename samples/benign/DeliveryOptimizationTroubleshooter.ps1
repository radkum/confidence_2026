.DESCRIPTION
 Troubleshoot Delivery Optimization by performing device health checks and peer-to-peer configuration of the device. This PowerShell script is officially signed by Microsoft.
#>

<#
    .SYNOPSIS
        Script for:
        - Checking Device, Network, DO, P2P and MCC Settings.
        - Generating a support bundle with diagnostic information.

    .PARAMETER HealthCheck
        A Health Checker script that displays settings to help the user to validate if there are any wrong settings in the user device, network, DO.

    .PARAMETER P2P
        Show to user the P2P efficiency of the device, errors found and Policy settings.

    .PARAMETER MCC
        Show MCC settings to allow customers to ensure the Windows device can correctly connect to the CacheHost server on the network, for supported content downloads.

    .PARAMETER AsObjects
        Changes the output of the script to return PowerShell objects instead of formatted text, allowing for easier integration with other tools and scripts.

    .PARAMETER GenerateSupportBundle
        Generates a comprehensive support bundle containing logs, configuration, and diagnostic information.

    .PARAMETER ReproduceIssueWithVerboseLogs
        Used with GenerateSupportBundle. Enables verbose logging and waits for user to reproduce the issue before capturing logs.

    .EXAMPLE
        To run all script verifications

            DeliveryOptimizationTroubleshooter.ps1
